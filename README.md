🎓 Task 3: College Event Feedback Analysis:

As part of my Data Analytics Internship at Future Interns, I successfully completed Task 3, where I analyzed College Event Feedback data using Python in Google Colab.

📌 Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected from various college events. The dataset response contains multiple categories such as Cultural, Sports, Technical, Workshops, and Fests. The main goal was to clean, process, and visualize the data to identify student preferences, satisfaction levels, and areas for improvement.

🔍 Key Insights:

1. Top 3 Events with highest satisfaction levels identified
2. Year-wise & Department-wise participation trends analyzed
3. Feedback ratings distribution visualized for each category
4. Average satisfaction score calculated across all events
5. Sentiment Categorization: Responses grouped into Positive, Neutral, and Negative

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

1. Python (Google Colab) – analysis and visualization
2. Pandas, NumPy – data cleaning & transformation
3. Matplotlib, Seaborn – charts and visualizations
4. CSV Handling – importing and analyzing event feedback

📊 Analysis Performed:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – removed missing/duplicate values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – event ratings & participation statistics
3. Visualization – plotted bar graphs, pie charts, and line charts
4. Sentiment Analysis – grouped responses into Positive, Neutral, Negative
5. Comparative Analysis – checked satisfaction levels across event categories
